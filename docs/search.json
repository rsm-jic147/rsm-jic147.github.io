    "text": "Data\n\nDescription\nThe dataset consists of 50,083 observations and 51 variables, drawn from a large-scale field experiment conducted by Karlan and List (2007) to study charitable giving behavior. Each observation represents a past donor who was randomly assigned to receive one of several fundraising letter treatments. These treatments varied in terms of match ratio, match threshold, and suggested donation amount.\nThe dataset includes:\nTreatment assignment variables, indicating whether individuals were in the control group or received a match offer, and if so, the match ratio (e.g., 1:1, 2:1, 3:1) and threshold size ($25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or unstated).\nSuggested donation amounts based on individuals’ previous giving history, which were randomly varied in the letters.\nDonation outcomes, including whether the individual gave and how much they gave.\nDemographic and donation history, such as gender, relationship status, number of years since the first donation, and prior donation frequency.\nGeographic and political context, with data on the political leaning of the recipient’s state and county (e.g., red/blue states), as well as census-linked socioeconomic indicators like median income, education, and urbanicity at the zip code level.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the Stata file\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Show the first few rows\nprint(df.head())\n\n   treatment  control    ratio  ratio2  ratio3      size  size25  size50  \\\n0          0        1  Control       0       0   Control       0       0   \n1          0        1  Control       0       0   Control       0       0   \n2          1        0        1       0       0  $100,000       0       0   \n3          1        0        1       0       0  Unstated       0       0   \n4          1        0        1       0       0   $50,000       0       1   \n\n   size100  sizeno  ... redcty  bluecty    pwhite    pblack  page18_39  \\\n0        0       0  ...    0.0      1.0  0.446493  0.527769   0.317591   \n1        0       0  ...    1.0      0.0       NaN       NaN        NaN   \n2        1       0  ...    0.0      1.0  0.935706  0.011948   0.276128   \n3        0       1  ...    1.0      0.0  0.888331  0.010760   0.279412   \n4        0       0  ...    0.0      1.0  0.759014  0.127421   0.442389   \n\n   ave_hh_sz  median_hhincome    powner  psch_atlstba  pop_propurban  \n0       2.10          28517.0  0.499807      0.324528            1.0  \n1        NaN              NaN       NaN           NaN            NaN  \n2       2.48          51175.0  0.721941      0.192668            1.0  \n3       2.65          79269.0  0.920431      0.412142            1.0  \n4       1.85          40908.0  0.416072      0.439965            1.0  \n\n[5 rows x 51 columns]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\nTreatment\n\n\ncontrol\nControl\n\n\nratio\nMatch ratio\n\n\nratio2\n2:1 match ratio\n\n\nratio3\n3:1 match ratio\n\n\nsize\nMatch threshold\n\n\nsize25\n$25,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize50\n$50,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize100\n$100,000 match threshold\n\n\nsizeno\nUnstated match threshold\n\n\nask\nSuggested donation amount\n\n\naskd1\nSuggested donation was highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd2\nSuggested donation was 1.25 x highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd3\nSuggested donation was 1.50 x highest previous contribution\n\n\nask1\nHighest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask2\n1.25 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask3\n1.50 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\namount\nDollars given\n\n\ngave\nGave anything\n\n\namountchange\nChange in amount given\n\n\nhpa\nHighest previous contribution\n\n\nltmedmra\nSmall prior donor: last gift was less than median $35\n\n\nfreq\nNumber of prior donations\n\n\nyears\nNumber of years since initial donation\n\n\nyear5\nAt least 5 years since initial donation\n\n\nmrm2\nNumber of months since last donation\n\n\ndormant\nAlready donated in 2005\n\n\nfemale\nFemale\n\n\ncouple\nCouple\n\n\nstate50one\nState tag: 1 for one observation of each of 50 states;

By showing that variables like mrm2, freq, female, etc. are not significantly different, the authors give readers confidence that:\n\nThere’s no selection bias\nAny differences in donation outcomes (like gave or amount) can be causally attributed to the treatment"

This tells us something important about human behavior: small cues or framing changes (like mentioning a matching grant) can make people more likely to give.\nIn particular, this experiment shows that:\n\nPsychological nudges, such as the presence of a matching donor, can shift decisions.\nEven minimal changes in language or perceived impact can meaningfully influence behavior.\nPeople respond to social signals of generosity, even if the financial incentive is unchanged.\n\nFrom a behavioral perspective, this suggests: - People are more likely to give when they believe their donation will be matched — it increases the perceived impact of their gift. - This change in behavior is not driven by financial incentives alone (since the match isn’t actually paid to them) but by psychological framing and the feeling that their donation will be “worth more.”\nIn the context of the Karlan & List study, this result supports the idea that small nudges, such as the presence of a matching grant, can meaningfully shift behavior — a key finding for fundraisers and behavioral economists alike.\n\n## replicate of table 3\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Clean the data\ndf_clean = df[['gave', 'treatment']].dropna()\n\n# Probit regression\nprobit_model = smf.probit('gave ~ treatment', data=df_clean).fit(disp=0)\n\n# Get marginal effects\nmfx = probit_model.get_margeff(method='dydx').summary_frame()\n\n# Display results\nprint(\"\\n=== Probit Regression (Marginal Effects) ===\")\nprint(mfx)\n\n\n=== Probit Regression (Marginal Effects) ===\n              dy/dx  Std.

Hi.  \ntreatment        0.007036  \n\n\nTo replicate Table 3, Column 1 from Karlan & List (2007), I ran a probit regression where the outcome variable was whether an individual made any charitable donation (gave) and the explanatory variable was assignment to the treatment or control group.\nI then calculated marginal effects to make the results directly comparable to those reported in the paper.\nThe estimated marginal effect of the treatment was 0.0043, with a standard error of 0.0014 and a p-value of 0.0019. This means that being assigned to the treatment group increased the probability of donating by about 0.43 percentage points. The result is statistically significant at the 1% level, matching the original paper’s finding of a 0.004* effect.\nThis confirms the authors’ key result: framing the ask as part of a matching donation offer has a measurable and statistically significant impact on giving behavior. Even though the increase in donation probability is relatively small, it provides compelling evidence that simple nudges — like mentioning a match — can influence real-world decisions in meaningful ways.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n# t-test\nprint(df['ratio'].unique())\n\n# Filter to treatment group only with valid match ratio and donation status\ndf_filtered = df[(df['treatment'] == 1) & (df['gave'].notnull()) & (df['ratio'].isin([1, 2, 3]))]\n\n# Subset donation status by match ratio\ngave_1to1 = df_filtered[df_filtered['ratio'] == 1]['gave']\ngave_2to1 = df_filtered[df_filtered['ratio'] == 2]['gave']\ngave_3to1 = df_filtered[df_filtered['ratio'] == 3]['gave']\n\n# Compute mean response rates\nmeans = {\n    \"1:1\": gave_1to1.mean(),\n    \"2:1\": gave_2to1.mean(),\n    \"3:1\": gave_3to1.mean()\n}\n\n# Conduct pairwise t-tests\nt_2v1 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_2to1, gave_1to1, equal_var=False)\nt_3v1 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_3to1, gave_1to1, equal_var=False)\nt_3v2 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_3to1, gave_2to1, equal_var=False)\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"=== Mean Donation Rates ===\")\nfor k, v in means.items():\n    print(f\"{k} match: {v:.4%}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n=== T-Test Results ===\")\nprint(f\"2:1 vs 1:1: t = {t_2v1.statistic:.3f}, p = {t_2v1.pvalue:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"3:1 vs 1:1: t = {t_3v1.statistic:.3f}, p = {t_3v1.pvalue:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"3:1 vs 2:1: t = {t_3v2.statistic:.3f}, p = {t_3v2.pvalue:.4f}\")\n\n# Plot response rates by match ratio\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nplt.bar(means.keys(), means.values(), color=['#4daf4a', '#377eb8', '#984ea3'])\nplt.ylabel('Proportion Who Donated')\nplt.title('Donation Rates by Match Ratio')\n\n# Add value labels\nfor label, val in means.items():\n    plt.text(label, val + 0.0005, f'{val:.3%}', ha='center')\n\nplt.ylim(0, max(means.values()) + 0.01)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n['Control', 1, 2, 3]\nCategories (4, object): ['Control' &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3]\n=== Mean Donation Rates ===\n1:1 match: 2.0749%\n2:1 match: 2.2633%\n3:1 match: 2.2733%\n\n=== T-Test Results ===\n2:1 vs 1:1: t = 0.965, p = 0.3345\n3:1 vs 1:1: t = 1.015, p = 0.3101\n3:1 vs 2:1: t = 0.050, p = 0.9600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results fully support the authors’ interpretation on page 8.\n“While the match treatments relative to a control group increase the probability of donating, larger match ratios—$3:$1 and $2:$1—relative to a smaller match ratio ($1:$1) have no additional impact.”\nEven though the donation rates numerically increase with larger match ratios, the t-tests show these increases are not statistically significant.\n\n# regression\n# Filter treatment group and create dummy variables\ndf_ratio_reg = df[(df['treatment'] == 1) & (df['gave'].notnull()) & (df['ratio'].isin([1, 2, 3]))].copy()\n\ndf_ratio_reg['ratio1'] = (df_ratio_reg['ratio'] == 1).astype(int)\ndf_ratio_reg['ratio2'] = (df_ratio_reg['ratio'] == 2).astype(int)\ndf_ratio_reg['ratio3'] = (df_ratio_reg['ratio'] == 3).astype(int)\n\n# Regression: gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3 (baseline is 1:1)\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nmodel = smf.ols('gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3', data=df_ratio_reg).fit()\nprint(model.summary())\n\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

The results show small positive coefficients for both 2:1 (0.0019) and 3:1 (0.0020) match rates, but neither is statistically significant (p &gt; 0.3). This indicates that while higher match ratios slightly increase donation rates, the differences are not meaningful. These findings support the authors’ interpretation that increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 does not significantly affect the probability of donating.\n\n# data vs. regression\n\n# Step 1: Compute response rate differences directly from the data\ndirect_diff_21_vs_11 = gave_2to1.mean() - gave_1to1.mean()\ndirect_diff_31_vs_21 = gave_3to1.mean() - gave_2to1.mean()\n\n# Step 2: Compute the differences in coefficients from regression\n# Since ratio1 (1:1) is the baseline, it has a coefficient of 0\n# So: ratio2 - ratio1 = coef_ratio2, ratio3 - ratio2 = coef_ratio3 - coef_ratio2\nreg_diff_21_vs_11 = model.params['ratio2']\nreg_diff_31_vs_21 = model.params['ratio3'] - model.params['ratio2']\n\n# Format results\n{\n    \"Direct Difference (2:1 vs 1:1)\": direct_diff_21_vs_11,\n    \"Direct Difference (3:1 vs 2:1)\": direct_diff_31_vs_21,\n    \"Regression Coeff.

The 2:1 match rate yields a very small increase in response over 1:1, while the jump from 2:1 to 3:1 is virtually nonexistent. This reinforces the conclusion that larger match ratios beyond 1:1 do not meaningfully increase the likelihood of donation.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\n# t-test  vs bivariate\n# Filter for treatment and control groups with valid donation amounts\ndf_amount = df[df['amount'].notnull() & df['treatment'].isin([0, 1])]\n\n# Perform a t-test on donation amounts between treatment and control\namount_treatment = df_amount[df_amount['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\namount_control = df_amount[df_amount['treatment'] == 0]['amount']\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(amount_treatment, amount_control, equal_var=False)\n\n# Run a bivariate linear regression of amount on treatment\namount_model = smf.ols('amount ~ treatment', data=df_amount).fit()\namount_summary = amount_model.summary2().as_text()\n\n# Extract regression results\ncoef = amount_model.params['treatment']\npval = amount_model.pvalues['treatment']\nconf_int = amount_model.conf_int().loc['treatment'].tolist()\n\n{\n    \"t_test\": {\n        \"t_statistic\": t_stat,\n        \"p_value\": p_val\n    },\n    \"regression\": {\n        \"coef\": coef,\n        \"p_value\": pval,\n        \"95% CI\": conf_int\n    },\n    \"regression_summary\": amount_summary\n}\n\nprint(\"=== Effect of Treatment on Donation Amount ===\")\n\n# T-test results\nprint(\"\\nT-test comparing treatment vs. control:\")\nprint(f\"t-statistic: {t_stat:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"p-value:     {p_val:.4f}\")\n\n# Regression results\nprint(\"\\nRegression of amount on treatment:\")\nprint(f\"Treatment coefficient: {coef:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"p-value:              {pval:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"95% Confidence Interval: [{conf_int[0]:.3f}, {conf_int[1]:.3f}]\")\n\n=== Effect of Treatment on Donation Amount ===\n\nT-test comparing treatment vs. control:\nt-statistic: 1.918\np-value:     0.0551\n\nRegression of amount on treatment:\nTreatment coefficient: 0.154\np-value:              0.0628\n95% Confidence Interval: [-0.008, 0.315]\n\n\nThis analysis helps us understand whether the treatment affects not just the likelihood of donating, but also how much people give. The results from both the t-test and regression show that people in the treatment group donate about $0.15 more on average than those in the control group. However, this difference is only marginally statistically significant (p ≈ 0.06), and the confidence interval includes zero.\nFrom this, we learn that while the treatment (a matching offer) strongly influences whether people donate, it has a much weaker and less certain effect on the amount given. This suggests that the psychological nudge of a match offer may primarily work by encouraging participation — getting more people to donate — rather than motivating donors to give significantly more money.\n\n## limited to donate\n\n# Filter to include only donors (gave = 1) with valid amount and treatment status\ndf_positive_donors = df[(df['gave'] == 1) & (df['amount'].notnull()) & (df['treatment'].isin([0, 1]))]\n\n# T-test: compare average donation amount between treatment and control groups among donors only\namount_treatment = df_positive_donors[df_positive_donors['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\namount_control = df_positive_donors[df_positive_donors['treatment'] == 0]['amount']\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(amount_treatment, amount_control, equal_var=False)\n\n# Regression: amount ~ treatment among donors\ndonor_model = smf.ols('amount ~ treatment', data=df_positive_donors).fit()\ncoef = donor_model.params['treatment']\npval = donor_model.pvalues['treatment']\nconf_int = donor_model.conf_int().loc['treatment'].tolist()\nsummary_text = donor_model.summary2().as_text()\n\n{\n    \"t_test\": {\n        \"t_statistic\": t_stat,\n        \"p_value\": p_val\n    },\n    \"regression\": {\n        \"coef\": coef,\n        \"p_value\": pval,\n        \"95% CI\": conf_int\n    },\n    \"regression_summary\": summary_text\n}\nprint(\"=== Effect of Treatment on Donation Amount (Among Donors Only) ===\")\n\n# T-test results\nprint(\"\\nT-test:\")\nprint(f\"t-statistic: {t_stat:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"p-value:     {p_val:.4f}\")\n\n# Regression results\nprint(\"\\nRegression:\")\nprint(f\"Treatment coefficient:     {coef:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"p-value:                   {pval:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"95% Confidence Interval:   [{conf_int[0]:.3f}, {conf_int[1]:.3f}]\")\n\n=== Effect of Treatment on Donation Amount (Among Donors Only) ===\n\nT-test:\nt-statistic: -0.585\np-value:     0.5590\n\nRegression:\nTreatment coefficient:     -1.668\np-value:                   0.5615\n95% Confidence Interval:   [-7.305, 3.968]\n\n\nInterpretation of Regression Coefficient (Among Donors Only)\nThe regression coefficient on treatment is -1.668, meaning that among those who donated, individuals in the treatment group gave about $1.67 less on average than those in the control group. However, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.561), and the confidence interval ([-7.31, 3.97]) includes zero, indicating high uncertainty in the estimate.\nThis tells us that conditional on donating, the treatment had no clear effect on the amount given.\nDoes the Coefficient Have a Causal Interpretation?\nNo — this coefficient does not have a causal interpretation. By restricting the analysis to donors only, we introduce selection bias, because treatment status may influence the likelihood of appearing in this subset (i.e., whether someone donates). Since the treatment affects who is included in the analysis, the estimated difference in donation amounts is not a valid causal estimate.\nInstead, this result is descriptive: it tells us that among donors, there is no significant difference in how much people gave depending on whether they were in the treatment group or not.\n\n## make 2 plot\n\n# Filter for donors with non-zero donation amounts and treatment assignment\ndf_donors = df[(df['gave'] == 1) & (df['amount'] &gt; 0) & (df['treatment'].isin([0, 1]))]\n\n# Split into control and treatment groups\ncontrol_donors = df_donors[df_donors['treatment'] == 0]['amount']\ntreatment_donors = df_donors[df_donors['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\n\n# Compute means\nmean_control = control_donors.mean()\nmean_treatment = treatment_donors.mean()\n\n# Plot histograms side by side\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4), sharey=True)\n\n# Control group histogram\naxes[0].hist(control_donors, bins=30, color='lightgray', edgecolor='black')\naxes[0].axvline(mean_control, color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Mean = ${mean_control:.2f}')\naxes[0].set_title('Control Group: Donation Amounts')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Donation Amount ($)')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Number of Donors')\naxes[0].legend()\n\n# Treatment group histogram\naxes[1].hist(treatment_donors, bins=30, color='lightblue', edgecolor='black')\naxes[1].axvline(mean_treatment, color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Mean = ${mean_treatment:.2f}')\naxes[1].set_title('Treatment Group: Donation Amounts')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Donation Amount ($)')\naxes[1].legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots visually confirm what your regression showed earlier: Although the treatment group received matching offers, they donated slightly less on average than the control group, conditional on donating. However, the distributions are quite similar overall, and the difference in means is not statistically significant.\nThis supports the idea that:\n“Matching offers increase the likelihood of giving, but do not meaningfully affect how much people give, once they’ve already decided to donate.”"

I repeated this process 10,000 times and recorded the difference in sample means between the treatment and control groups in each replication.\nResults The histogram of the simulated mean differences shows a clear bell-shaped distribution centered near 0.004, which is the true difference in population probabilities.\nInterpretation The Law of Large Numbers is reflected in how the average of the simulated differences converges toward the true difference ( 0.022−0.018=0.004) as we increase the number of replications.\nThe Central Limit Theorem explains why the distribution of these sample differences is approximately normal, even though the underlying data are binary (non-normal). This justifies using t-tests and confidence intervals in practice.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\n\n# Simulation parameters\np_control = 0.018\np_treatment = 0.022\nn_control = 100000\nn_treatment = 10000\nsimulations = 10000\n\n# Simulate draws\ncontrol_sample = np.random.binomial(1, p_control, n_control)\ntreatment_sample = np.random.binomial(1, p_treatment, n_treatment)\n\n# Draw 10,000 random pairs and calculate differences\ndiffs = []\nfor _ in range(simulations):\n    control_draw = np.random.choice(control_sample)\n    treatment_draw = np.random.choice(treatment_sample)\n    diffs.append(treatment_draw - control_draw)\n\n# Convert to array and compute cumulative average\ndiffs = np.array(diffs)\ncumulative_avg = np.cumsum(diffs) / np.arange(1, simulations + 1)\n\n# Plot cumulative average with reference line at true mean difference (0.004)\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.plot(cumulative_avg, label='Cumulative Average', color='blue')\nplt.axhline(0.004, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True Difference (0.004)')\nplt.title('Cumulative Average of Simulated Differences')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Simulations')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Average Difference')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and reinforce the intuition behind the t-statistic, I simulated 100,000 binary outcomes from a control distribution with a probability of donation p=0.018, and 10,000 binary outcomes from a treatment distribution with p=0.022. These distributions represent the underlying probabilities of donation in each group from the original charitable giving experiment.\nFrom these two populations, I randomly drew 10,000 treatment–control pairs and computed the difference in outcomes for each pair. The plot above shows the cumulative average of these 10,000 differences, alongside the true difference in means (0.004) indicated by a red dashed line.\nWhat the Plot Shows\n\nThe cumulative average starts out noisy due to randomness in small samples.\nAs more differences are accumulated, the average stabilizes and converges toward the true population difference of 0.004.\nThis convergence visually confirms the Law of Large Numbers: with enough samples, the sample average approaches the expected value.\nIt also reinforces the foundation of the Central Limit Theorem — although each individual outcome is binary (not normally distributed), the sampling distribution of the mean becomes approximately normal.\n\nThe simulation shows that the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means between treatment and control groups. This not only demonstrates core statistical principles like the LLN and CLT, but also helps explain why test statistics like the t-statistic work reliably in large samples — even when the underlying data is not continuous or normally distributed.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\n# Parameters\np_control = 0.018\np_treatment = 0.022\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nreps = 1000\n\n# Set up plots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\n# Loop over sample sizes and simulate mean differences\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    mean_diffs = []\n    for _ in range(reps):\n        control_sample = np.random.binomial(1, p_control, n)\n        treatment_sample = np.random.binomial(1, p_treatment, n)\n        diff = treatment_sample.mean() - control_sample.mean()\n        mean_diffs.append(diff)\n\n    # Plot histogram of mean differences\n    ax = axes[i]\n    ax.hist(mean_diffs, bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black', density=True)\n    ax.axvline(x=0, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Zero')\n    ax.axvline(x=np.mean(mean_diffs), color='blue', linestyle='-', label='Mean')\n    ax.set_title(f\"Sample Size: {n}\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Mean Difference (Treatment - Control)\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Density\")\n    ax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nAt small sample sizes (n = 50): The distribution is wide and somewhat irregular. Zero lies close to the center, meaning we often can’t distinguish treatment from control.\nAs the sample size increases: The distributions become tighter, more symmetrical, and more normal-shaped — a direct illustration of the CLT.\nBy n = 500 or 1000: The distribution is clearly centered around the true mean difference (~0.004), and zero shifts toward the tail, suggesting we now have enough data to statistically distinguish treatment from control in many simulations.\n\nThese plots demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem in action: as the sample size grows, the sampling distribution of the mean difference becomes more normal and more concentrated around the true value. The probability of observing an effect near zero — assuming the true difference is 0.004 — shrinks with larger sample sizes, improving our ability to detect a real effect."
